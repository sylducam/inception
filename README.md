# inception

www.42lyon.fr school project.

Inception can be seen as a continuum of www.github.com/sylducam/ft_server. The goal here is to have an example website working, using a set of containers, each running one of the site's underlying needed applications. All of the containers are orchestrated by a YAML file, e.g. srcs/docker-compose.yml, itself launched by a Makefile. The whole project has to be running in a virtual machine.

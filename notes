Maybe adding a file to a post, e.g. an image is not possible in the current state of my work. You would need to add a chown just like in ft_server.

If you EXPOSE a port in a Dockerfile and you don't use a yaml (docker-compose)
this port will be open to the outside.
In the case of this project, as the three containers are on the same network
(networks that is closed, to my understanding), it's not a security issue but
it would be in another context.
